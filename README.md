A simple Ransomware Simulation to terrify (educate) users
 
Simply run deploy.bat and it will change the background to a Ransomware scare wallpaper, hide icons, 
and set up a scheduled task to annoy users with a popup.

To revert changes, use cleanup.bat and restart the device. Icons will need to be manually shown again.
Right-click the desktop, go to View, and then select "Show Desktop Icons".
